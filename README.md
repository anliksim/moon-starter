# Moon Starter

![Moon banner](docs/moon_banner.png)

Starter for [moonrepo](https://moonrepo.dev/) using various programming languages and tools.

**Why moonrepo?**

I was looking for monorepo tooling that I enjoy working with. Nx is a great tool but even after years of working with javascript and js-based tooling I am doing everything possible to reduce the places where I have to use it. With the rise of Rust and Rust-based tooling to replace every single js-based tool out there, it seems there are many like-minded people in the community.


## Getting started

> Note this setup is based on WSL2 (5.15.90.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 x86_64 GNU/Linux). If you use any other systems, some installations might be different.
